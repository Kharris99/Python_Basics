In Python, numbers are classified into several types, and each type has its own behavior and usage. Here's an overview of the main number types and how they work in Python:

1. Integer (int)
      Whole numbers without a fractional component (e.g., 1, 100, -42).
Usage:
You can perform standard arithmetic operations
Python int type has no size limit (it's only limited by available memory), so you can work with very large integers.

2. Floating Point (float)
      Numbers that have a fractional part, represented by a decimal point (e.g., 3.14, 0.001, -7.5).
Usage:
Supports arithmetic operations just like integers 
 -however may involve precision limitations due to how floating-point numbers are stored in memory.
Floats c an represent very small or very large numbers using scientific notation (e.g., 1.2e3 for 1200).

3. Complex Numbers (complex)
Description: Numbers with both a real and an imaginary component. Python represents them as a + bj where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.
Usage:
Useful in scientific and engineering computations.
You can access the real part with .real and the imaginary part with .imag.

4. Boolean (bool)
Description: A type that represents truth values True and False, but under the hood, True is equivalent to 1 and False is equivalent to 0.
Usage:
Can be used in arithmetic operations, where True behaves like 1 and False behaves like 0.
