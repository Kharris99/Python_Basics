Understanding Numbers In Python 
Python has two number types: integers and floats 
   -integer = whole numbers (positive or negative) 
   -floats = numbers with decimal point ex.) 1.0 
Note: when doing math in python integers will always be rounded down to the whole number. In order to get an answer in decimal form use float. 
ex.) 1.0/1.0 =1.0 or 18.5/5.2 ==3.558
